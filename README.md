# SAFE
Simulation Code for Saturating Adaptive Field Estimator

Generate the mesh network .mat file, first, using GenerateMeshNetwork.m. Then, run MeshSAFE.m (or MeshSAFEMultiTrial.m for multiple trials) to simulate SAFE. PlotMeshNetwork.m and PlotMeshSAFE.m (PlotMeshSAFEMultiTrial.m) may be used to visualize the communication network and the simulation data.
